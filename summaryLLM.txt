The LLM powered application is a calendar system that will log events down to the specific month, day and year of said event. The system specifically takes in the month and day from the end user but our year assignment is handled automatically. Each event is given a description along side its date and the event is added to a list of events stored in the calendar for later calls if necessary. The overall format is focused on streamlined simplicity and the Ollama agent implementation. The code beyond the calendar app will use specific agents to complete the mandatory tasks.
